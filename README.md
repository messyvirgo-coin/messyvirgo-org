# messyvirgo-org

This repository holds **organization-level files and artefacts** for the **Messy Virgo** organization and community (see **[messyvirgo.com](https://messyvirgo.com)**).

Messy Virgo’s public-facing work includes **Messy Virgo Coin ($MESSY)** and the broader **AI-assisted crypto research / due diligence tooling** described in the project’s litepaper and build log.

## About this repo

This is the place for **cross-repo / org-wide** collaboration: governance, processes, templates, and shared artefacts that don’t belong in a single code repository.

This repository is **not a software/code repository**. It is intentionally **documents + brand assets** (logos, avatars, media, templates, etc.) plus other organizational artefacts.

## What this repo is for

Use this repo for shared, org-wide materials such as:

- **Policies & governance**: bylaws, meeting notes, decision records, charters, role descriptions
- **Community docs**: onboarding, contribution processes, event playbooks, moderation guidelines
- **Brand & communications**: logos, style guides, press kits, templates, copy drafts
- **Operational artefacts**: checklists, runbooks, vendor/partner notes (non-sensitive only), planning docs

## What this repo is not for

- **Secrets** (API keys, passwords, private links, access tokens)
- **Personal data** about members (unless explicitly intended for public release and lawfully shareable)
- **Confidential internal information** or anything that could endanger people or the organization

If you’re unsure whether something should be public, **don’t commit it**—open an issue to discuss instead.

## How to contribute

- **Read this first**: participation norms are covered by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **Member-led changes**: this repo is public for transparency, but **changes to org documents are primarily made by association members** (or explicitly invited contributors).
- **Non-members**: you’re welcome to **open issues** with suggestions/feedback. PRs from non-members may be declined or asked to be routed through a member sponsor.

For details, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Governance & membership

- **Governance**: see [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md)
- **Membership**: see [MEMBERSHIP.md](./MEMBERSHIP.md)

## Project context (from messyvirgo.com)

- **$MESSY**: an AI-focused crypto project on Base aiming to make complex AI + DeFi concepts more accessible, with a roadmap from foundation → research tooling → execution → community governance.
- **Tooling direction**: a modular “**Lens**” approach for repeatable, testable due diligence (e.g. Technical Analysis Lens, Macro Economics Lens), with humans in the loop.

This repo is **not investment advice** and is not intended to encourage trading. It exists to coordinate open, auditable collaboration around org-level artefacts and (where applicable) open-source components.

## Suggested structure (optional)

As this repo grows, a simple structure helps:

- `governance/` — bylaws, roles, elections, decision records
- `meetings/` — agendas, minutes, notes
- `community/` — onboarding, contribution guides, moderation
- `brand/` — logos, brand guidelines, templates
- `ops/` — runbooks, checklists, playbooks

## Brand docs

- [brand/TAGLINES.md](./brand/TAGLINES.md)
- [brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md](./brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md)

## Decision making & governance

We aim for transparent, documented decisions:

- **Default**: discuss in issues, decide in PRs, and record outcomes in docs.
- **When needed**: maintainers may request a lightweight “decision record” (ADR-style) for significant changes.

## Communication

- **Primary**: GitHub Issues and Pull Requests in this repository
- **Optional**: link to your community chat/forum here when available (e.g. Discord/Matrix/Slack)
