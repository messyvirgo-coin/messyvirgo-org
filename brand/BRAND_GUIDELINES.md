# Messy Virgo Brand Guidelines (Basics)

## Brand Essence
- Friendly, calm confidence.
- Transparent, on-chain, verifiable.
- Technically credible without being cold.
- "Smart helper" energy: clear, patient, and focused.

## Voice & Tone
- Plain language, short sentences, minimal jargon.
- Warm but precise; confident without hype.
- Prefer concrete claims over buzzwords.

## Color Guidance (Core Brand)
Use the primary logo as the source of truth for core colors.

Primary files:
- `brand/logos/logo.svg` (vector master)
- `brand/logos/logo-800.png` (raster)

Core palette cues:
- Deep indigo / night violet base
- Bright magenta + violet accents
- Cyan highlights
- Soft neutral/skin tones in character art

## Imagery Palette (Hero Reference)
Reference:
- `brand/imagery/hero/hero-1.jpg`
- `brand/imagery/hero/hero-2.jpg`
- `brand/imagery/hero/hero-prompt.md`

Imagery should feel **slightly warmer than neutral**:
- Soft amber/yellow sunset highlights (subtle, not dominant)
- Supporting tones: pink, violet, and blue
- Neon accents should be controlled and not overpower the scene

### Icon Exception
The **icon/avatar** can be **very bright, shiny magenta** to pop on both light and dark backgrounds. This does **not** mean full-scene imagery should be neon-heavy.

## Imagery Rules (Do/Don’t)
Do:
- Keep the character as the focal point; add complexity toward the edges.
- Use diegetic charts only: on screens, printed surfaces, reflections, or **projected from a visible source** (console/projector).
- Allow tiny generic UI labels (e.g., "VOL", "RISK") if needed.

Don’t:
- No floating UI panels without a clear source.
- No large ticker strings, currency symbols, or heavy numeric overlays.
- No watermarks, corner badges, or random logos.

## Logo Usage Basics
- Use the SVG when possible; PNGs for web/social.
- Maintain aspect ratio and clear space; do not stretch.
- Do not recolor the logo; keep original palette.
- Ensure sufficient contrast against background imagery.
