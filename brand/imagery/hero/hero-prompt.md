# Hero Variant 1: "Messy in the Command Center"

Generate an anime-style illustration in **ultra-wide banner format (3:1 aspect ratio)**: Messy Virgo, exactly the same character and face as in the reference file. Keep all facial features, proportions, and the general look of the hair unchanged and consistent.

## Setting & Scene

Messy is positioned slightly off-center in a **sleek, modern, high-tech command center or control room at sunset**. Imagine large glass windows framing a cityscape beyond, polished steel and chrome surfaces, multiple illuminated screens and holographic displays scattered throughout the space. The environment feels **sophisticated and powerful—like mission control for financial operations.**

The overall scene features **sunset lighting** with **warm golden-yellow / amber highlights** (present but not overpowering) complementing the existing pink and blue colors. The scene should be **slightly warmer** overall than neutral, with the sunset expressed as a **balanced gradient** that can also incorporate **pink, violet, and cooler blue tones** in the sky and reflections, while the yellow remains as gentle rim light, edge highlights, and soft glows on metal and glass. This should blend with the **poppy-punk mood with subtle neon colors in blue, pink, and violet** emanating from screens, ambient lighting, and reflections on glass and metal surfaces. The background is partly photorealistic: glowing monitors and interfaces, reflections on sleek surfaces, soft silhouettes of equipment and workstations, glass walls creating depth, and an overall sense of **technology serving human intelligence.**

## Crypto & Financial Overlays

There are a few abstract charts for macroeconomics, trading, and crypto (simple candlestick charts, smooth curves, sparklines, minimalist grids) rendered as subtle UI content. **Avoid symbol-heavy finance UI**: no dollar signs, percent signs, currency symbols, ticker strings, or big numeric labels. If any text appears at all, keep it to tiny, generic UI labels (e.g., “VOL”, “RISK”) and keep it barely noticeable.

All visuals must be **physically anchored and logical**: charts must live on monitors, be projected from an actual console/projector, or appear as reflections on glass—**no free-floating panels** drifting in mid-air with no source. Keep the overlays sparse, subtle, and non-dominant so the scene feels rich yet uncluttered, with complexity increasing slightly toward the edges while Messy remains the calm, harmonious focal point.

All **candlestick charts must be financially correct and realistic**: green candles represent upward price movement (close higher than open) and red candles represent downward movement (close lower than open), with clearly defined bodies and wicks reflecting proper OHLC structure; no inverted color logic, no monochrome candles, no abstract styling, and no decorative or misleading visuals—the chart should read instantly as a real market chart to any trader.

Any stylized coin/token icon should be limited to a clean, minimal **MESSY emblem** (no “$” prefix, no currency marks).

## Messy's Appearance & Positioning

Messy is visible **from the side (profile view)**, facing towards the right, with an **interesting cinematic camera angle** that captures her from the side—like in cinema. This creates visual interest and depth. She is positioned **slightly to the left or right of center**, perhaps near or touching a holographic interface or screen display.

Messy wears a simple, modern, elegant, and slightly sexy outfit suitable for a professional in high-end finance/tech/crypto: perhaps a sharp, stylish blazer or a fitted top with a subtle low-cut or off-shoulder element, paired with sleek high-waisted trousers or a clean skirt. Minimal accessories—perhaps a delicate bracelet or small earrings.

## Expression & Hand Action

**Expression**: Calm confidence blended with intellectual focus. Her eyes are bright and purposeful, with a subtle, knowing half-smile suggesting complete mastery and clarity. She looks like someone who understands the big picture and is entirely in control.

**In her hands**: If she holds a **slim, modern device** (tablet/phone), the **screen must face Messy** in a physically correct way (she can read it). The device should be oriented consistently with her grip and viewing angle—not flipped toward the viewer as if held backwards. If the viewer sees the screen at all, it should be only a partial, angled glimpse or a subtle reflection. Alternatively, she could be **gesturing gracefully** toward a display that is clearly anchored to a nearby console/screen, or simply standing with hands relaxed—let the device choice be flexible.

## Perspective & Composition

Half-figure to upper body (roughly knees-up to chest-up) so that the face is clearly visible. The image should be cleanly rendered, highly detailed, with a harmonious composition that keeps Messy in sharp focus against a dynamically complex but not distracting high-tech background. The perspective should show Messy **from the side with an interesting cinematic camera angle**—not dead-on, but angled to create visual interest and depth, like in cinema.

## Color Palette & Mood

The overall image should be **slightly warmer** than neutral, with:
- **Soft golden-yellow / amber** sunset highlights (present but not dominant)
- **Pink** tones in neon accents and parts of the sunset gradient
- **Blue** tones in screens, reflections, and parts of the sunset gradient
- **Violet** tones in ambient lighting and parts of the sunset gradient
- The sunset should feel cohesive and natural: yellow as highlights + pink/blue/violet as supporting tones

## Emotional Tone

Overall feel: **"Mastery. Clarity. Control. Intelligence serving power."** This is Messy as the architect of your financial future—calm, brilliant, and entirely confident.
