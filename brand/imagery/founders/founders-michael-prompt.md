# Prompt for Founder Michael

Generate an anime-style illustration in 3:2 landscape format: Michael, keeping the same consistent face, hairstyle, and proportions as in the reference image. The character should appear clearly and recognizably in every variation.

Michael is positioned centrally in a very modern, slightly futuristic IT Department at night, with modern computers, some people,  large glass surfaces and distant city lights stretching into the background.

The overall scene is rather dark, with a poppy-punk mood and subtle neon accents in blue, pink, and violet, but not too bright. The background is partly photorealistic: reflections on wet or glossy surfaces, glass walls and windows, soft silhouettes of people and office furniture, and deep perspective suggesting a large, busy environment.

There are a few abstract charts and symbols for macroeconomics, trading, and crypto (simple candlestick charts, smooth yield or price curves, percent and fictive crypto currency signs) rendered as partly drawn, partly holographic overlays. These elements are smoothly integrated into the surroundings, glass reflections, screens, or city/office signage around Michael; they should not appear as big, separate floating UI blocks. They must stay sparse, subtle, and non-dominant so the scene feels rich yet uncluttered, with complexity increasing slightly toward the edges while Michael remains the calm, harmonious focal point in the center.

Michael wears a simple, modern, elegant and slightly sexy outfit suitable for a professional in high-end finance/tech/crypto, such as a slim-fit dress shirt with the top button casually open, or a sharp, well-tailored blazer over a plain shirt, with minimal accessories; no overly revealing or overly muscular clothing emphasis.

Expression: relaxed, enjoying what he's doing, confident. 

He's working on a laptop coffee mug next to him.

Perspective: Half-figure to upper body (roughly knees-up to chest-up) so that the face is clearly visible. The image should be cleanly rendered, highly detailed, with a harmonious composition that keeps Michael in sharp focus against a dynamically chaotic but not distracting IT Department background.
