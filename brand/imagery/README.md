## AI-Generated Images

Some images in this directory were created using artificial intelligence. The prompts used for generation can be found in the [`prompts/`](./prompts/) folder.

### Generation Process

To create consistent images:

- Use the office prompt (`prompts/prompt-messy-dark-office.md`) for general Messy variations
- Use the city prompt (`prompts/prompt-messy-dark-city.md`) for urban variations
- Use the character prompt (`prompts/prompt-any-character.md`) for other characters/settings
- Use the macro economics prompt (`prompts/macro-regime-prompt.md`) for macro economics-specific images
- Generate images using Perplexity with the SeeDream 4.5 model
- This workflow ensures consistent visual style and character consistency across all generated imagery
