# Prompt for Allocator Profile

Generate an anime-style illustration in 3:2 landscape format: Messy Virgo, exactly the same character and face as in the reference file. Keep all facial features, proportions, and the general look of the hair unchanged and consistent.
​

Messy is standing centrally on a broad avenue of a large modern metropolis at night, reminiscent of New York’s Times Square or Broadway, with tall glass buildings, digital billboards, and city lights stretching into the distance.
​

The overall scene is rather dark, with a poppy-punk mood and subtle neon colors in blue, pink, and violet, but not too bright. The background is partly photorealistic: wet asphalt reflecting neon lights, blurred yellow taxis, soft silhouettes of pedestrians, and big screens and signs creating a busy night-city atmosphere.
​

There are a few **abstract chart hints** (clean candlestick silhouettes, simple trend lines, minimal curves) but they must be **fully diegetic**: shown only on **real-world surfaces** like digital billboards, LED tickers, screens, posters, or reflected signage in glass—never as graphics floating in mid-air. They must be sparse and understated, not dense and dominant.

**Hard constraints**: no floating HUD overlays, no corner badges, no watermarks, no standalone currency symbols, and no random logos/text sprinkled around. If any token mark appears, limit it to **at most one subtle “MESSY” wordmark (no dollar sign)** on a distant in-world screen/sign (small, non-dominant, slightly out of focus), and **do not show any other coins/logos**.

​
Messy wears a polished, understated, and elegant outfit that evokes a steward of capital rather than a desk trader: a long-line tailored blazer or softly structured coat over a high-quality, simple top, combined with wide-leg trousers or a refined skirt and minimalist premium shoes; the silhouette is more relaxed, with a slightly layered look, signaling someone who spends more time in strategy meetings and portfolio reviews than in rapid-fire execution.
​

Her expression: composed, thoughtful, and slightly detached from the immediate price action, with a relaxed gaze that looks past the screen or over the city rather than locked on a single chart; her gentle, confident half-smile suggests she is thinking in multi-year regimes, risk budgets, and manager selection, embodying a long-term allocator mindset instead of a trade-by-trade mentality.
​

She presents the viewer a sleek tablet screen that is clearly visible. It shows a very simple, high-level crypto allocation / funds view—one and maybe a single time-horizon indicator, with no candlestick charts and no trade tickets.

Perspective: Half-figure to upper body (knees up) so that face is clearly visible. Body turned slightly to the right.Cleanly rendered, highly detailed, slightly sexy, with a harmonious composition keeping Messy in focus and a dynamically chaotic but not distracting urban night background.
