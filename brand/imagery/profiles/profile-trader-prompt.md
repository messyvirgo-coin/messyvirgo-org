# Prompt for Trader Profile: "The Advanced Trader"

Generate an anime-style illustration in 3:2 landscape format: Messy Virgo, exactly the same character and face as in the reference file. Keep all facial features, proportions, and the general look of the hair unchanged and consistent.

## Scenery & Setting

Messy is standing centrally in an **ultra-busy, ultra-luxurious exchange hall at peak market hours**—think **a roaring trading floor** inside a **marble-and-brass atrium** with a VIP-mezzanine, like NYSE energy fused with high-end boutique luxury. Below her, the floor is packed with fast-moving silhouettes, runners, and operators; the air feels electric, loud, and urgent. Around the hall, massive **in-world tickers and exchange screens** wrap the architecture, and the space is layered with **glass railings, polished stone, velvet lounge corners, chrome details**, and subtle luxury cues (champagne bar, tailored staff, premium materials).

The overall scene is **rather dark but intensely alive**, with **poppy-punk mood and subtle neon colors in blue, pink, and violet** coming from **real screens, LED tickers, and architectural lighting**—not from floating graphics. The background is **partly photorealistic**: glossy marble floors reflecting neon light, depth through a multi-level hall, glass and brass catching highlights, motion-blurred professionals in the pit, and high-fidelity screens integrated into the environment.

Messy stands as a **calm, surgically precise presence above the chaos**—the still point in a room that is moving at maximum speed.

## Crypto & Financial Overlays

There are a few **abstract chart hints** (candlestick silhouettes, clean trend lines) but they must be **fully diegetic**: shown only on **real-world surfaces** like LED tickers, exchange screens, wall displays, or reflections on glass and polished metal inside the exchange hall. They should read as part of the venue’s infrastructure, not as UI graphics added on top of the image.

**Hard constraints**: no floating HUD overlays, no corner badges, no watermarks, no standalone currency symbols. If a token mark appears, limit it to **at most one subtle “MESSY” wordmark (no $ sign)** on a distant in-world ticker/screen (small, non-dominant, slightly out of focus), and **no other coins/logos**.

## Messy's Appearance & Style

Messy wears a **refined, modern, elegant, slightly sexy outfit that clearly signals an experienced operator in the market**: a fitted blazer or cropped jacket over a simple top, paired with sleek high-waisted trousers or a clean skirt and practical sneakers or low heels. She looks ready for fast execution and smart decision-making.

**Accessories**: just a slim watch or small earrings, emphasizing agility and **"at-the-screen" professionalism** rather than corporate formality. Her outfit exudes confidence and tactical precision.

## Messy's Expression & Body Language

**Expression**: calm, intensely focused, and tactically confident. **Her eyes are locked on the viewer**, maintaining professional eye contact as if explaining a setup. She displays a subtle micro-smile of certainty—the look of a mentor teaching a student. She embodies a **technical trader who has identified the move and is now guiding the viewer through it**.

**In her hands**: She wears a **wireless headset** and holds an **iPad or tablet screen facing outward to the viewer**. She positions the tablet as a visual aid for her advice, making sure the viewer sees the **financial candlestick chart** on the screen. The chart shows a short- or medium-term timeframe with **clear levels and support/resistance marks**—clean, uncluttered, and serving as the evidence for her consulting advice.

All **candlestick charts must be financially correct and realistic**: green candles represent upward price movement (close higher than open) and red candles represent downward movement (close lower than open), with clearly defined bodies and wicks reflecting proper OHLC structure; no inverted color logic, no monochrome candles, no abstract styling, and no decorative or misleading visuals—the chart should read instantly as a real market chart to any trader.

## Visual Tone & Composition

The overall feel should be: **"a sharp, disciplined trader executing from a position of luxury at peak market hours,"** with energy and focus but no panic or hesitation. Messy is the still point above the roaring pit, the strategist who always knows what to do next.

**Perspective**: Half-figure to upper body (knees up) so that face is clearly visible. Body turned slightly to the left (toward her iPad or screen). Cleanly rendered, highly detailed, slightly sexy, with a harmonious composition keeping Messy in focus and a dynamically energetic but not distracting **luxury exchange hall** background (VIP mezzanine + trading pit below).
