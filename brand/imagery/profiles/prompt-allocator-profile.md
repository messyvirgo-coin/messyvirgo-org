Generate an anime-style illustration in 3:2 landscape format: Messy Virgo, exactly the same character and face as in the reference file. Keep all facial features, proportions, and the general look of the hair unchanged and consistent.
​

Messy is standing centrally on a broad avenue of a large modern metropolis at night, reminiscent of New York’s Times Square or Broadway, with tall glass buildings, digital billboards, and city lights stretching into the distance.
​

The overall scene is rather dark, with a poppy-punk mood and subtle neon colors in blue, pink, and violet, but not too bright. The background is partly photorealistic: wet asphalt reflecting neon lights, blurred yellow taxis, soft silhouettes of pedestrians, and big screens and signs creating a busy night-city atmosphere.
​

There are a few abstract charts and symbols for macroeconomics, trading and crypto (simple financial candlestick shapes, soft curves, percent or dollar signs) as partly drawn, partly holographic overlays fully but very sublte integrated into billboards, reflections, and city signage around her; not stand-alone / floating. They must be sparse and understated, not dense and dominant. Any stylized coin or token icon should be limited to clean, minimal $MESSY emblems only; do not show any other coins or logos at all. These macro/crypto hints may become slightly more visible and textured toward the edges of the scene, but overall they should stay light, minimal, and non-intrusive, so the image feels rich yet uncluttered while Messy remains the calm, harmonious focal point in the center.

​
Messy wears a polished, understated, and elegant outfit that evokes a steward of capital rather than a desk trader: a long-line tailored blazer or softly structured coat over a high-quality, simple top, combined with wide-leg trousers or a refined skirt and minimalist premium shoes; the silhouette is more relaxed, with a slightly layered look, signaling someone who spends more time in strategy meetings and portfolio reviews than in rapid-fire execution.
​

Her expression: composed, thoughtful, and slightly detached from the immediate price action, with a relaxed gaze that looks past the screen or over the city rather than locked on a single chart; her gentle, confident half-smile suggests she is thinking in multi-year regimes, risk budgets, and manager selection, embodying a long-term allocator mindset instead of a trade-by-trade mentality.
​

In her hands she holds / she is doing: a sleek tablet showing a very simple, high-level $MESSY exposure or allocation view—one or two large shapes (like a pie slice or bar) and maybe a single time-horizon indicator—no candlestick charts, no trade tickets; she might be calmly swiping between high-level views or tapping once to rebalance.
​

Perspective: Half-figure to upper body (knees up) so that face is clearly visible. Cleanly rendered, highly detailed, slightly sexy, with a harmonious composition keeping Messy in focus and a dynamically chaotic but not distracting urban night background.
