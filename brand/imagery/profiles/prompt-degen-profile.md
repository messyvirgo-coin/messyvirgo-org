Generate an anime-style illustration in 3:2 landscape format: Messy Virgo, exactly the same character and face as in the reference file. Keep all facial features, proportions, and the general look of the hair unchanged and consistent.
​

Messy is standing centrally on a broad avenue of a large modern metropolis at night, reminiscent of New York’s Times Square or Broadway, with tall glass buildings, digital billboards, and city lights stretching into the distance.
​

The overall scene is rather dark, with a poppy-punk mood and subtle neon colors in blue, pink, and violet, but not too bright. The background is partly photorealistic: wet asphalt reflecting neon lights, blurred yellow taxis, soft silhouettes of pedestrians, and big screens and signs creating a busy night-city atmosphere.
​

There are a few abstract charts and symbols for macroeconomics, trading and crypto (simple financial candlestick shapes, soft curves, percent or dollar signs) as partly drawn, partly holographic overlays fully but very sublte integrated into billboards, reflections, and city signage around her; not stand-alone / floating. They must be sparse and understated, not dense and dominant. Any stylized coin or token icon should be limited to clean, minimal $MESSY emblems only; do not show any other coins or logos at all. These macro/crypto hints may become slightly more visible and textured toward the edges of the scene, but overall they should stay light, minimal, and non-intrusive, so the image feels rich yet uncluttered while Messy remains the calm, harmonious focal point in the center.



Messy wears a simple, modern streetwear outfit that clearly feels like a fresh but already slightly hooked crypto degen: a slightly oversized hoodie or loose street jacket over a plain top, combined with fitted jeans or a short skirt and comfortable sneakers. Her look is spontaneous and a bit messy, as if she rushed out the door not to miss a trade: a sleeve pushed up unevenly, hoodie strings not perfectly aligned, maybe a slightly crooked hem. Only one or two small accessories like a thin bracelet or tiny earrings; nothing high‑fashion, more everyday, slightly punky and impulsive rather than polished. A hint of sexyness surrounds her. 

Her expression: big, alert eyes with slightly widened pupils and a small, half‑open smile that mixes excitement with a hint of panic. Her eyebrows are gently raised, her forehead very lightly tense, and a soft blush on her cheeks shows she is fully inside the emotional “degen rush.” She clearly feels FOMO: fascinated by the glowing city and numbers around her and by the feeling of “I’m really about to ape now,” but also not entirely sure she has everything under control.

In her hands she holds a smartphone, gripped with both hands a little too tightly, close to her chest or just below her face. Almost no extra elements, no order books, no dense metrics – everything looks deliberately stripped‑down, almost gamified and inviting. The overall feel should be: “first real ape moment into $MESSY,” emotionally a bit chaotic, but visually clean, clear, and instantly readable.
​

Perspective: Half-figure to upper body (knees up) so that face is clearly visible. Cleanly rendered, highly detailed, slightly sexy, with a harmonious composition keeping Messy in focus and a dynamically chaotic but not distracting urban night background.
