Generate an anime-style illustration in 3:2 landscape format: Messy Virgo, exactly the same character and face as in the reference file. Keep all facial features, proportions, and the general look of the hair unchanged and consistent.
​

Messy is standing centrally on a broad avenue of a large modern metropolis at night, reminiscent of New York’s Times Square or Broadway, with tall glass buildings, digital billboards, and city lights stretching into the distance.
​

The overall scene is rather dark, with a poppy-punk mood and subtle neon colors in blue, pink, and violet, but not too bright. The background is partly photorealistic: wet asphalt reflecting neon lights, blurred yellow taxis, soft silhouettes of pedestrians, and big screens and signs creating a busy night-city atmosphere.
​

There are a few abstract charts and symbols for macroeconomics, trading and crypto (simple financial candlestick shapes, soft curves, percent or dollar signs) as partly drawn, partly holographic overlays fully but very sublte integrated into billboards, reflections, and city signage around her; not stand-alone / floating. They must be sparse and understated, not dense and dominant. Any stylized coin or token icon should be limited to clean, minimal $MESSY emblems only; do not show any other coins or logos at all. These macro/crypto hints may become slightly more visible and textured toward the edges of the scene, but overall they should stay light, minimal, and non-intrusive, so the image feels rich yet uncluttered while Messy remains the calm, harmonious focal point in the center.


​
Messy wears a refined, modern, elegant, slightly sexy outfit that clearly signals an experienced operator in the market: a fitted blazer or cropped jacket over a simple top, paired with sleek high-waisted trousers or a clean skirt and practical sneakers or low heels; she looks ready for fast execution, with just a slim watch or small earrings as accessories, emphasizing agility and “at-the-screen” professionalism rather than corporate formality.
​

Her expression: calm, intensely focused, and tactically confident, with eyes directed at her screen and a slight, concentrated frown or micro-smile; she reads as someone who thinks in short- to medium-term moves, reacting quickly but with discipline, embodying a technical trader who lives inside the flow of intraday and swing setups.
​

In her hands she holds / she is doing: a single slim smartphone or tablet showing one clean $MESSY candlestick chart on a short- or medium-term timeframe with a few clear levels—no clutter of indicators or heavy text—while she interacts with it using one hand (tapping or swiping to adjust an order).
​

Perspective: Half-figure to upper body (knees up) so that face is clearly visible. Cleanly rendered, highly detailed, slightly sexy, with a harmonious composition keeping Messy in focus and a dynamically chaotic but not distracting urban night background.
