# Base prompt for icons

Generate a square image to be used as an icon for ...
​

The image should be extremely reduced: flat or semi‑flat vector style, clear geometric basic shapes, soft edges, no fine textures, no small UI details, and no typography. The focus is on a single central symbol that remains clearly recognizable even at very small sizes (e.g. 24–32 px). No fully developed scene, no complex backgrounds, at most 1–2 very subtle decorative elements in the background.
​

Color palette: dark background (almost black or very dark blue/violet) with gentle, soft glow. The **central symbol should pop with a bright, shiny magenta/pink** so it reads clearly on both dark and light backgrounds. Secondary accents can include violet and a touch of cyan, but keep the focus on the magenta core. Set brightness and contrast so the icon is bold and attention-grabbing while still clean and professional.
​

Light and mood: subtle screen/neon glow, no strong reflections or realistic rendering. The overall mood should be confident and crisp; the icon can be more intense than full-scene imagery, but still clean and controlled.
​

Optionally, very reduced, semi‑transparent shapes can appear in the background that evoke crypto charts or data (e.g. 1–2 stylized financial OHLC-candlesticks, a calm curve, or suggested nodes), but they must never overlay or distract from the central symbol. No complete charts, no text blocks, only symbolic hints.
