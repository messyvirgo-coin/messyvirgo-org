# Base prompt for icons

Generate a square image to be used as an icon for ...
​

The image should be extremely reduced: flat or semi‑flat vector style, clear geometric basic shapes, soft edges, no fine textures, no small UI details, and no typography. The focus is on a single central symbol that remains clearly recognizable even at very small sizes (e.g. 24–32 px). No fully developed scene, no complex backgrounds, at most 1–2 very subtle decorative elements in the background.
​

Color palette: dark background (almost black or very dark blue/violet) with gentle, soft glow. Accent colors in slightly muted neon blue, pink, and violet, inspired by night city lights and crypto trading screens, but not garish or overloaded. Set brightness and contrast so that the central symbol stands out clearly and the icon as a whole feels calm, controlled, and professional – a pro‑level crypto tool with a slightly punk edge, but without “noise”.
​

Light and mood: subtle screen/neon glow, no strong reflections or realistic rendering. The overall mood should be calm, confident, and slightly optimistic – like a reliable research agent that brings structure into the “messy” crypto market.
​

Optionally, very reduced, semi‑transparent shapes can appear in the background that evoke crypto charts or data (e.g. 1–2 stylized financial OHLC-candlesticks, a calm curve, or suggested nodes), but they must never overlay or distract from the central symbol. No complete charts, no text blocks, only symbolic hints.
