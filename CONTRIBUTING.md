# Contributing to messyvirgo-org

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Messy Virgo organization’s org-level repository.

This repo is for **shared organisational artefacts** (docs, templates, governance notes, community resources). Contributions can be small (typos, clarifications) or large (new policies, new templates, new structures).

## Ground rules

- **Be respectful**: follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **Keep it public-safe**: do not include secrets, personal data, or confidential information.
- **Prefer clarity over cleverness**: write for readers outside your context.
- **No financial advice**: this repo is not a venue for investment recommendations.

## Who can contribute changes

This repository is public for transparency, but it represents **Messy Virgo association-level** artefacts.

- **Association members**: welcome to open issues and submit PRs.
- **Non-members**: welcome to open issues with feedback/suggestions. PRs from non-members are **not guaranteed to be accepted** and may require a **member sponsor** (or an explicit invitation by maintainers).

If you want to become a member, see [MEMBERSHIP.md](./MEMBERSHIP.md).

## Ways to contribute

- **Open an issue** to propose a new artefact, change, or discussion topic
- **Submit a pull request** to improve existing docs or add new ones
- **Review**: comment on issues/PRs, suggest improvements, and help with editorial quality

## Before you open a PR

- **Search existing issues/PRs** to avoid duplicating work
- **Start a discussion** (issue) for significant changes so we agree on direction early
- **Keep PRs focused**: one topic per PR when possible

## Pull request checklist

- **Explain intent**: what problem does this solve and who is the audience?
- **Link the issue**: reference the related discussion if applicable
- **Keep sensitive info out**: re-check files for secrets and personal data
- **Use plain language**: avoid internal-only jargon or add definitions

## Reviews & merging

We try to be welcoming and timely:

- **Maintainers** will review PRs and may request edits
- **Small changes** can be merged quickly
- **Bigger changes** may need a longer discussion window or explicit approval, depending on impact

For governance/roles, see [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md).

## What “members can contribute” means

- **Association members**
