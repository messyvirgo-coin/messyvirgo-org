# Governance

This repository contains **organization-level artefacts** for the Messy Virgo association/community. It is public for transparency, but changes are **member-led**.

### Roles

- **Members**: association members who participate in discussions and may propose changes.
- **Maintainers**: members with write access who review/merge pull requests and keep docs consistent.

### Decision making

- **Small changes** (typos, clarifications, routine updates): can be merged by a maintainer after review.
- **Substantive changes** (policies, governance docs, anything affecting members or public commitments): should have an issue for discussion and may require explicit approval by maintainers (or the association’s agreed decision process).

### Contribution boundaries

- This repo is public, but **the association retains editorial control** over its official documents.
- Non-member contributions are welcome as **feedback via issues**. PRs from non-members may be accepted when clearly beneficial, but may also be declined or requested to proceed with a member sponsor.

### Contacts

- **Maintainers**: `@messy-michael`, `@MessyFranco`
- **Association contact**: `contact@messyvirgo.com`
